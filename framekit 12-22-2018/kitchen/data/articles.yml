    <p>WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Fannie Mae (FNMA/OTC) today began marketing its eighth sale of reperforming loans as part of the company's ongoing effort to reduce the size of its retained mortgage portfolio.</p>

    <p>The sale consists of approximately 18,400 loans, having an unpaid principal balance of approximately $3.59 billion, and is available for purchase by qualified bidders. Interested bidders can register here, at http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/funding-the-market/npl/index.html.</p>

    <p>This sale of reperforming loans is being marketed in collaboration with Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Bids are due on September 6, 2018.</p>

    <p>Reperforming loans are mortgages that were previously delinquent, but are performing again because payments on the mortgages have become current with or without the use of a loan modification. The terms of Fannie Mae's reperforming loan sale require the buyer to offer loss mitigation options designed to be sustainable to any borrower who may re-default within five years following the closing of the reperforming loan sale. In addition, buyers must report on loss mitigation outcomes. Any reporting requirements cease once a loan has been current for twelve consecutive months after the closing of the reperforming loan sale.</p>

    <p>Interested bidders can register for ongoing announcements, training, and other information at http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/funding-the-market/npl/index.html. Fannie Mae will also post information about specific pools available for purchase on that page.</p>
