<p>You know saving for a down payment is one of your buyers’ biggest obstacles. What if you could be a homeownership hero and show them there’s help available for down payment and closing costs? We’ll show you how to start a conversation with more buyers by highlighting information about down payment programs in your marketing, website and social media. You’ll also learn how Down Payment Resource’s agent tool, Down Payment Connect, can match your clients to down payment programs in your market and generate leads right to your inbox.</p>
