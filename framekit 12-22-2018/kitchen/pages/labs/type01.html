<h1> On-demand gig economy finds new data points in Fannie Mae 2018 housing reports, enabling vast market changes and improvements</h1>
<p>
   On-demand gig economy services such as transportation, lodging, food/goods delivery, and personal task services are growing and reshaping how we think about work and self-employment.1 Our National Housing Survey® found that nearly one-fifth of American adults have provided a service through the gig economy.2 Because of the "on-demand" nature, the income stream can be less stable. With the rise of the gig economy, Fannie Mae's Economic & Strategic Research (ESR) Group surveyed senior mortgage executives through its quarterly Mortgage Lender Sentiment Survey® to understand lenders' views about using gig economy income in mortgage underwriting.
</p>


<h5>Survey findings include:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>71 percent of lenders say that they have had borrowers apply for a mortgage with gig economy income over the past year.</li>
    <li>89 percent expect the number of borrowers who would want to use gig economy income to qualify for mortgage loans to grow in the next few years.</li>
    <li>68 percent think accepting gig economy income will help low- to moderate-income consumers access mortgage credit.</li>
    <li>95 percent think it is difficult to use gig economy income to approve mortgage applications with today's lending practices. Top barriers include unpredictability and instability of gig economy income, investor requirements, and underwriting criteria standardization.</li>
    <li>69 percent of lenders say current underwriting guidelines for self-employment income verification are about right, while 24 percent suggest easing existing standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Given the growth of the gig economy and its impact on how self-employed people work and earn income, the inclusion of gig worker income for mortgage underwriting should not be overlooked. Borrowers with a sufficient income history that fit within investors' guidelines are being served today, but a majority of lenders say that it is difficult to underwrite a mortgage loan with gig economy income due to its instability and unpredictability. This very nature of gig economy income makes it difficult to meet investor requirements, although most lenders believe that the current underwriting standards for self-employed borrowers are about right.
</p>

<p>
    To make home financing more accessible to gig economy workers, we see the potential for new tools that could help verify and assess their income. For example, emerging technologies such as application program interfaces (APIs) and artificial intelligence could automate the verification of gig income from tax returns, payroll information, and bank statements, and help to assess income stability and predictability. Understanding how gig income borrowers and other self-employed borrowers are paid and how they report their income on their tax returns could help inform ways to streamline the verification and risk assessment process. Such future improvements fit into the bigger goals of improving the loan origination process and enhancing the borrower experience by minimizing tedious manual processes.

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup class="note">1</sup> Gig-economy workers tend to have flexible work arrangements, working on single projects or tasks, commonly on demand. Examples include transportation (e.g., Uber and Lyft), lodging rental (e.g., Airbnb and VRBO), food/goods delivery (e.g., Postmates), and personal task services (e.g., TaskRabbit). Fannie Mae does not endorse these companies. These examples do not represent the whole sector of gig economy.
