<h1>Homeownership</h1>

<p>Home is where the heart is. And it's at the heart of everything we do.</p>
<p>Our commitment to home starts with our mission to provide liquidity, access, and affordability of mortgage credit across
    the country, in all markets, at all times. That's been our focus since we began 80 years ago. And it remains our focus
    today.</p>
<p>We work on behalf of buyers and renters to ensure access to affordable and sustainable housing. It's what we do and why we
    exist. And it's why we’re making home a reality for millions of buyers and renters each and every year. In the second
    quarter of 2018, Fannie Mae provided $125 billion in liquidity to fund the housing market – helping individuals and families
    to buy, refinance, or rent approximately 665,000 homes.</p>

<h4>Homebuyers</h4>
<p>A one-size-fits-all approach to homeownership doesn't always work&nbsp;because today's buyers are unique. That's why our
    focus is on creating products and programs that meet diverse buyer needs. We’re also committed to providing the education
    and tools buyers need to prepare for homeownership.</p>
<p>We've developed affordable solutions – including our HomeReady
    <sup class="note">®</sup> mortgage. It offers expanded eligibility and removes barriers to homeownership for responsible, qualified buyers.
    HomeReady lets buyers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Finance up to 97 percent of the purchase price.</li>
    <li>Use non-traditional income sources – like family and tenants – to help qualify.</li>
    <li>Access homeownership education to prepare for buying and owning a home.</li>
</ul>
<p>We offer tools and resources to help throughout the purchase and mortgage process. Because we want buyers to make knowledgeable
    and responsible housing decisions. We help prepare consumers to buy and own a home through our innovative and award-wining
    consumer
    <a href="http://www.knowyouroptions.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and
    <a href="http://www.knowyouroptions.com/homeapp/" target="_blank">mobile app</a> – as well as through an online homeownership
    <a href="https://homeready.frameworkhomeownership.org/Default.aspx"
        target="_blank">course</a> from our partner, Framework. We also work with agencies and organizations to offer pre-purchase counseling
    and information on down-payment assistance.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Homeowners</h4>
<p>Our commitment extends to homeowners. Our goal is to stabilize communities and ensure sustainable homeownership, whenever
    possible. That's why we offer post-purchase programs – modification and foreclosure prevention – designed for homeowners
    with
    <a href="https://www.knowyouroptions.com/loanlookup" target="_blank">Fannie Mae owned-loans</a>.</p>
<p>Homeowners also have access to our Mortgage Help Network. It offers free, personalized mortgage assistance through a housing
    counseling agency approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Homeowners can work with a counselor to
    review their situation and determine available options. Counselors work with the homeowner and their mortgage company
    throughout the process.</p>
<p>We've put these programs in place to help homeowners and communities. And they're succeeding. In the first half of 2018,
    we helped distressed families retain their homes or avoid foreclosure through 64,000 workout solutions.</p>

<h4>Renters</h4>
<p>Home doesn't always mean homeownership. We work to ensure communities, individuals, and families have access to quality rental
    housing at an affordable price. We are a leading provider of financing for multifamily properties. Every year we finance
    hundreds of thousands of units of rental housing.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae's
    <a href="http://www.knowyouroptions.com" target="_blank">knowyouroptions.com</a> also helps educate renters who may be entering the market or trying to determine if renting is
    the right option. And we offer assistance to renters living in a Fannie Mae foreclosed property. Our
    <a href="http://www.knowyouroptions.com/rent/my-rental-home-is-in-foreclosure/tenant-in-place-rental-program"
        target="_blank">Tenant-in-Place Rental Program</a> offers leasing options to qualified renters occupying a foreclosed Fannie Mae property.
    Additionally, there may be other programs, non-profit partners, and legal protection available to help tenants. Contact
    the Fannie Mae Resource Center for more details.
